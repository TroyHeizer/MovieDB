# MovieDB

Thank you for taking the time to explore my movie database project.

As an avid movie enthusiast, I endeavored to create a comprehensive tool to meticulously catalog the films that I find enjoyable. This project is an ongoing endeavor, and I have plans to incorporate additional features in the future.

The application is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system developed in Blazor, utilizing Entity Framework Core and SQLite for seamless functionality and efficient data management.

To get started, simply clone this repository into Visual Studio, save your changes, and press the play button. This should enable you to access and explore the project effortlessly.

If you have any inquiries or suggestions, please do not hesitate to reach out. Your feedback is highly valued and appreciated.
